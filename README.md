# Post file to FTP or Web Service
Use the code in curl-functions.php to create a connection to a web service and successfully upload a file with an optional log.
## Usage
Change the vars to connect to the web service you need. Usually these URLs have security parameters so change them where necessary.

Delete the file_put_conents if you don't want to keep a log of successful uploads.
